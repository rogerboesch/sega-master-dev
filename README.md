# Development for the SEGA Mega Drive (on macOS)

## Introduction

This repo holds a more straightforward installation guide for macOS, both Intel and M1/M2 machines.
Binaries are pre-built and templates are adapted to use in Visual Studio Code.


## Copyright

The toolchain is built using the [marsdev repo](https://github.com/andwn/marsdev/tree/master).

All copyrights remain at the respective copyright holders. 
I just tried to save some work and make the installation even more flawless for other macOS programmers.


## Installation

### Dependencies

To use the toolchain, your Mac machine needs some tools installed.
I assume some of them you have already if you are a programmer

- Xcode command line tools
- Homebrew

Everything else is described below

### Packages installed with Homebrew

brew install wget
brew install java
